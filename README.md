## My homework for the C# Professional course, less-15_pro_Async_ Await
1. Redo the extra task from Lesson 11 using the async await construct.
2. Create a WPF application, place two buttons in the TextBox window. By clicking on the first
    button in the TextBox, the message "Connected to the database" is displayed, while in the handler
    set a delay of 3-5 seconds to simulate a connection to the database, this button also launches
    a timer that, at intervals of several seconds, displays the message â€œData
    received." When you press the second button, by analogy with the first, we disconnect from the base (with
    delay), display a message and stop the timer.
